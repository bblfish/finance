## About


This little finance calculator takes a CSV file of income or expenditures Orders and builds a Lazy List of infinite
unfolding Account States, each one month apart, generated by adding income and removing expenses from the account as specified by the orders.

One can evaluate the quality of the model by starting at a time in the past and checking if it arrives at the right sum
in the present. If the model arrives at the right conclusions one can then use it to project the state of one's account into the future.

The model of change is of a stream of changes, with as functions between given by the orders. The final coalgebra of these change functions gives the infinite stream (here a LazyList, which used to be called a Stream)

## The CSV change model

An example [data.csv](data/data.csv) file is available.
It consists of 5 columns

* **Topic**: short name (line item?)
* **Amount**: a positive or negative floating point giving the incoming or outgoing value
* **Repeat**: How often that is repeated: currently only `M` or `Month` for monthly repetations, or a date
  in `yyyy/mm/dd` format for a one time payment
* **Start**: Optional Start date in `yyyy/mm/dd` format
* **Ending**: Optional Ending date in `yyyy/mm/dd` format
* **Description**: more detailed descriptive information

Here is an example:

```csv
Topic:Amount:Repeat:Start:Ending:Description
Salary:2400:M:::Monthly Salary
WebServers:-19:M:::Scaleway
Rent:-800:Monthly:::
Electricity:-80:M:::
Internet:-50:M:::5G
```

## Running the model

One can run the code from inside `sbt`. Invoking
`run` gives a list of command line arguments

```commandline
$ sbt
sbt:finance-model> run
[info] running run
Error: Missing argument <file>
accounts 0.1
Usage: accounts [options] <file>

  <file>                file containing csv data in required format
  -a, --amount <value>  starting value in account
  -s, --start <value>   date in yyyy/mm/dd format to start from
  -m, --months <value>  months from start date to display           oo
```

We can then calculate 1 month starting with 159 in the bank from
August 2022. This adds the incoming and outgoins and lists each on a row. But note that it does not add the laptop
lease.

```sbt
sbt:finance-model> run data/data.csv -s 2022/08/25 -a 159 -m 1
[info] running run data/data.csv -s 2022/08/25 -a 159 -m 1
2022-08-25: remaining: € 159.0
     out: € -0.0
     in : € 0.0

2022-09-25: remaining: € 1160.0
     out: € 1399.0
     in : € 2400.0
   Salary:	 € 2400.0 Month	Monthly Salary

   Electricity:	 € -80.0 Month	
   Internet:	 € -50.0 Month	5G
   Insurance:	 € -50.0 Month	Legal insurance

TOTAL
=====
income: 2400.0 average: 2400.0 over 1 months
expend: -1399.0 average: -1399.0
```

We can then look at what happens over 3 months, allowing
us to see that if these were all the expenses, we should
have put 2700 aside.

```sbt
sbt:finance-model> run data/data.csv -s 2022/08/25 -a 159 -m 3

## TODO

There are many things one could do.

One simple one is that a Stream is a Comonad, and comanads are very useful to calculate changes in the state between past and future. So one could calulate local minima, etc...
